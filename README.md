### Joining:
A firework spawns! Is it not a beautiful entity? That was retorical ... Now, walk over to a mob. What do you see? A sexy-ass name :D

### Placing / Destroying:
Place and destroying is interesting. Another firework spawns. :o On top of that, one will see falling sand entities :o

### Boats / Minecart:
Boats are just too exciting for you. THEY CAN FLY! Minecarts, on the other hand, explode too often ...

### Explosions:
Upon exploding an entity will spawn a creeper. This will be abused later on ...

### Commands:
There is one command that will fit your needs.
* /entity <entity> - Spawns an entity.
* /entity <amount> <entity> - Spawns an amount of entites.
* /entity <amount> <entity1> <entity2> <...> - Spawns entity2 on entity1 a certain amount of times.

### Walking:
Diamond Boots are nice sexy armor. However, depending on the material you are on, more mobs spawn!
Although they might be fairly safe, DO NOT GO GAMEMODE AND FLY IN THE AIR!

Enjoy :)
