### Joining:
Upon joining, a firework will spawn. It is a very nice entity ;) Now, walk over to a mob. What do you see? A sexy-ass name :D
Slimes are called 'Jerry', Villagers are various clones, a Wither is called '[Pimp] Big Daddy', and the EnderDragon is called 'Mama Endy'.
Zombies give birth to baby pigs (AWWWWWWW)! All other mobs are randomly named. Now what do you do with that mob?
Right click it, but be careful! There is a 10% chance you will explode!

### Placing / Destroying:
Placing and destroying is interesting. Another firework spawns. :o On top of that, one will see falling block entities :o

### Boats:
Boats are just too exciting for you. THEY CAN FLY!

### Explosions:
Upon exploding, falling sand entities will fly like mad! Also, a creeper will spawn. This will be abused later on ...

### Commands:
Three commands, with tab completion can support your needs:
* `/entity <entity> - Spawns an entity. Permission: entity.single`
* `/entity <amount> <entity> - Spawns an amount of entites. Permission: entity.multiple`
* `/entity <amount> <entity1> <entity2> <...> - Spawns entity2 riding entity1. A certain amount of these stacks will be created! Permission: entity.multiple`

### Walking:
Diamond Boots are nice sexy armor. However, depending on the material you are on, more mobs will spawn!
Although you might be fairly safe, DO NOT FLY IN THE AIR!

Enjoy :)
