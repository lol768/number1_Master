Joining and Walking:

When one joins the server, a firework spawns :D. One will also be prompted with a 10 second safe period.
During this time, mobs will not spawn you move. After these 10 seconds, assuming one has not disconnected, mobs will begin to spawning.
Four mobs will surround you relatively 6 blocks away in the x and z direction according to the block you are standing on.


Placing and Destroying:

When one destroys or places a block, that block will shoot out a few blocks of that type (Falling Sand Entities).
Confusing, but interesting. Please don't place TNT. It is for your own benefit. A fireworkd will spawn as well :)


Mobs:

Mobs around the world spawn with interesting names.
If they explode, they make a special sound and spawn a creeper.
Zombies give birth to baby pigs!

Enjoy :)
